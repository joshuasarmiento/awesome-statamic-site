  **What is Y2k?**

  Tagged as the period that influenced countless recognizable trends in fashion and technology, Y2k simply means "Year 2000". Indeed, this era revolved around bright colors, creativity, and tech optimism, which people clearly missed. To illustrate, totally spies, powerpuff girls, pop culture, and neon signs filled the streets and television of every household before. And before you know it, the retro-futuristic era is back for another round!

  **What is Y2k's Distinct Aesthetic Period?**

  With Y2k's aesthetic, you can expect nothing short of encapsulating fashion, slick futuristic looks, and accent lighting. Without a doubt, the era is leaning a bit toward a more psychedelic vibe compared to the minimalist trend that made waves before. So if you are more into the subtle aesthetic, maybe this fun, quirky y2k aesthetic might not suit you. However, if you enjoy bold colors, futuristic fashion, unique styles, and inspired furnishings, this recent resurgence of crystal-beaded curtains is for you!

  **What is Y2k Room Decor?**

  The photo illustrated above is an illustration of Barbiecore aesthetics that depicts a strong y2k vibe. Aside from that, achieving a y2k aesthetic in a room requires a lot of flashy, mainstream it-girl items that will have your sanctuary looking like a Poblacion at night! With that, if you want to achieve this flashy style, you have to incorporate a lot of green, silver, purple, and patterns.
